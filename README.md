Format-Visualizer
=================

Format Visualizer

This project was initiallly started as a .NET project at CodePlex(http://formatvisualizer.codeplex.com/) back in 2008. Now, I don't use C# for my job any more, and even more Javascript is better language to provide a way to access in Web environment and build.

If you can not wait to see how it works and have already installed .NET Framework on your machine, why don't you try FormatVisualizer at Codeplex? I'm not sure that it works with the latest .NET Framework. :-)

Any feedback will be my pleasure.

Thanks.
