Format-Visualizer
=================

Format Visualizer

This project was initiallly started as .NET project at CodePlex(http://formatvisualizer.codeplex.com/) in 2008. Now, I don't use C# for my job, and even more Javascript is better language to provide a way to access in Web.

If you can't wait to see how it works and have installed .NET Framework on your machine, why don't you try FormatVisualizer at Codeplex? I'm not sure that it works with the latest .NET Framework. :-)

Any feed will be pleasure.

Thanks.
